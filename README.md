What I found really interesting about this article is how it points out that writing code isn’t actually the hardest part of building software, the real challenge is figuring out the requirements. The story about the client saying “that will never happen” and then later discovering that exact issue really stuck with me. It shows how much of the difficulty in software comes from unclear or changing expectations, not from the act of coding itself.

I also liked the comparison between chess, self-driving cars, and software development. Chess is straightforward because it has clear rules and objectives, so AI can dominate there. Driving and building software, on the other hand, are full of unpredictable situations and judgment calls. That made me think about how AI might be able to help with coding tasks but can’t really replace humans when it comes to understanding messy, real-world requirements. It feels like the article takes a realistic approach: AI might be great at rewriting old systems where the rules are already known, but it’s not going to magically solve the hardest parts of building new software.
